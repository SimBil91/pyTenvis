# pyTenvis
Python library for JPT3815 HD

This library implements full motor, video and 1 way audio control. It also tracks your face and moves the camera to keep it in its center.

I did not figure out yet how to send audio to the camera in order to e.g. respond to a question. So feel free to contribute!
